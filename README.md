# SQL

| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| üí° [8-Week SQL Challenges](https://github.com/KingRyan72/8-Week-SQL-Challenge) | Data analysis, data cleaning, data transformation | This project features solutions to 8 diverse case studies from the #8WeekSQLChallenge. It highlights my comprehensive proficiency in SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and complex problem-solving, demonstrating a strong foundation in data analysis.|

# Python

|---|---|---|---|
| üë©üèª‚Äçüíª [Automation Project to sort files](https://github.com/KingRyan72/8-Week-SQL-Challenge) | Programming, Automation | A practical Python script designed to automate file organization. This project demonstrates my ability to programmatically manage file systems by creating new directories and sorting various file types into their respective folders, effectively cleaning and organizing a cluttered directory. It serves as a strong example of my problem-solving skills and proficiency in using Python for automation tasks.| os, shutil |

# Machine Learning / Data Science

| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries / Modules |    
|---|---|---|---|
| üí≥ [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/KingRyan72/8-Week-SQL-Challenge) | Data Science, Machine Learning | This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It addresses the challenge of an imbalanced dataset by using the SMOTE technique to balance the classes. The project demonstrates a full machine learning workflow, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing to training and evaluating models like Random Forest and Decision Trees. Performance is evaluated using key metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and the results are visualized with a confusion matrix.| pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, imbalanced-learn (specifically SMOTE) |
