# SQL

| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| üí° [8-Week SQL Challenges](https://github.com/KingRyan72/8-Week-SQL-Challenge) | Data analysis, data cleaning, data transformation | This project features solutions to 8 diverse case studies from the #8WeekSQLChallenge. It highlights my comprehensive proficiency in SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and complex problem-solving, demonstrating a strong foundation in data analysis.|

# Python

| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries / Modules |    
|---|---|---|---|
| üë©üèª‚Äçüíª [Automation Project to sort files](https://github.com/KingRyan72/8-Week-SQL-Challenge) | Programming, Automation | A practical Python script designed to automate file organization. This project demonstrates my ability to programmatically manage file systems by creating new directories and sorting various file types into their respective folders, effectively cleaning and organizing a cluttered directory. It serves as a strong example of my problem-solving skills and proficiency in using Python for automation tasks.| os, shutil |

# Machine Learning / Data Science

| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries / Modules |    
|---|---|---|---|
| üìà [Predicting Employee Turnover](https://github.com/KingRyan72/KingRyan/blob/main/HR_Project.ipynb)| Data Science, Machine Learning, Business Analytics | This project presents a comprehensive machine learning analysis to predict employee turnover. The process includes thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering to address data leakage, and training a suite of tree-based models (Decision Tree and Random Forest). The project demonstrates proficiency in hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, model evaluation using key metrics like AUC and a confusion matrix, and interpreting results with feature importance plots. The final output is a robust, well-performing model that provides actionable insights for stakeholders to improve employee retention. | os, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, sklearn, pickle |
| üí≥ [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/KingRyan72/KingRyan/blob/main/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection_Machine%20Learning.ipynb)| Data Science, Machine Learning | This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It addresses the challenge of an imbalanced dataset by using the SMOTE technique to balance the classes. The project demonstrates a full machine learning workflow, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing to training and evaluating models like Random Forest and Decision Trees. Performance is evaluated using key metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and the results are visualized with a confusion matrix.| pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, imbalanced-learn (specifically SMOTE) | - |
| üìà [Predicting Sales with Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/KingRyan72/KingRyan/blob/main/Predicting%20Sales%20with%20Multiple%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb) | Data Science, Statistics, Business Analytics | This project performs a multiple linear regression analysis to predict sales for a small business based on their historical marketing data across channels like TV, social media, radio, and influencer promotions. The process includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), variable selection using plots and descriptive statistics, model creation and fitting, and checking key assumptions. The final output is an interpretable model that provides actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders to optimize their marketing budget and strategy. | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels |
